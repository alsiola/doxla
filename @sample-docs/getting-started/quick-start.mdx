# Quick Start

Get up and running with the Acme Widget Platform in under 5 minutes.

<Callout type="info">
This guide assumes you have Node.js 20+ installed. See the [full installation guide](installation.md) for detailed prerequisites.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @acme/widget-cli
```

## Step 2: Create a Project

```bash
acme init my-first-widget
cd my-first-widget
```

## Step 3: Start Developing

```bash
acme dev
```

Your widget is now running at `http://localhost:8080`.

<Callout type="warning">
The development server auto-reloads on file changes. If you see stale responses, check that your terminal shows the reload confirmation.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Deploy

When you're ready to go live:

```bash
acme deploy
```

You'll receive a production URL like `https://my-first-widget.acme.app`.

<Callout type="danger">
Deploying overwrites the current production version. Use `acme deploy --canary` for gradual rollouts.
</Callout>
